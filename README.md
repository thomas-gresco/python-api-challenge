## Summary
Using the OpenWeatherMapAPI, my goal was to visualize weather from over 500 cities with varying distances from the equator. 
I first created plots that compared the latitude of each city to different weather variables, such as temperature and cloudiness.
I then created linear regression lines for each of these plots to determine the correlation between the location and the weather variables.
This was done for both cities in the southern and nothern hemispheres.
In the next part, I used weather data skills to plan future vacations. In this part, I used the Geoapify API to help create different maps.
One map showed data points of differing sizes depending on the humidity and the next map was based off a new dataframe that found hotels in a specific radius with given weather specifications.
